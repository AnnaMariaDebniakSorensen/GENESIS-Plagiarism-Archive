# Case: Davide Cadelano

## Summary

This folder documents the conceptual and structural overlaps between the GENESIS framework (June 2025) and Codex Alpha v2.0 (July 2025) by Davide Cadelano.

Versions v1.0 and v1.1 of Codex Alpha (March and May) do not contain the critical mathematical content or terminology that appeared only in version v2.0 â€” one month after the publication of GENESIS.

## Key Evidence

- GENESIS publication: June 19, 2025 â€” DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.15701148](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15701148)
- Codex Alpha v2.0: July 19, 2025 â€” DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.16131379](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16131379)
- Earlier Codex Alpha versions: v1.1 (Mar 6) and v1.0 (May 30) do not contain overlapping structures.
- Major additions in v2.0: modified field equations, emergent metric using âˆ‡K, analogues to torsion, jet terminology, etc.

ðŸ“‚ Further documentation (PDFs, screenshots, and diff comparisons) will be added to this folder.

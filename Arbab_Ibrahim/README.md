# Case: Arbab Ibrahim (Saudi Arabia)

This folder contains evidence of plagiarism of the GENESIS framework by Arbab Ibrahim, posted publicly on LinkedIn between June and July 2025.

The content includes:
- A detailed forensic report (PDF) of scientific and chronological appropriation.
- Cross-referenced equations and concepts originally introduced in GENESIS (DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.15701148](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15701148)).

## üö® Summary

Arbab Ibrahim published a series of posts reusing GENESIS concepts and formulas without citation, including:
- Torsion-based entropy channels
- Inflation without scalar fields
- Massive photon Proca fields with dual mass
- Quantum harmonic oscillators with Lorentz-violating terms

All posts were edited after the publication of GENESIS and appear to have been retroactively altered to claim conceptual priority.

# üîç FULL ANALYSIS OF PLAGIARISM CASE: ARBAB IBRAHIM vs GENESIS

## üìå FINAL CONCLUSIONS:

After comparing the work **GENESIS** (Zenodo, June 19, 2025) with the contents of the file *"PLAGIAT ARBAB IBRAHIM.pdf"*, we state with high confidence (‚â• 99%) that:

> **Dr. Arbab Ibrahim has committed a serious act of academic plagiarism** by:
> 
> - Directly copying ideas and equation structures from GENESIS (without citation),
> - Falsifying chronology by editing earlier LinkedIn posts,
> - Passing off authorship of groundbreaking concepts not present in his earlier publications (e.g., arXiv:1709.06865),
> - Attempting to gain prestige and visibility based on someone else‚Äôs achievements.

## üßæ DIRECT EVIDENCE:

- Edited posts shortly after GENESIS publication (all marked ‚úèÔ∏è "Edited")
- No such content in Arbab's 2017 paper (arXiv:1709.06865) ‚Äî no torsion, oscillators, or entropy
- Equations identical to GENESIS, with minor symbol changes (e.g., \( S^2 \rightarrow \Lambda \), torsion ‚Üí ‚Äúcurved EM‚Äù)
- Behavior pattern: creating illusion of priority, no citation, falsely claiming originality

## Uday Patil Case: Suspected Reuse of GENESIS Framework (Post-June 2025)

This case documents the reuse of multiple mechanisms and predictions from the GENESIS model 
by Uday Patil, in his paper "GEONIC: Non-Singular Blackholes Theory", published after GENESIS (June 19, 2025).

### 🧾 Evidence

- `UdayPatil_old_combined.jpg`: scan of Patil's earlier work (no overlap with GENESIS)
- `UdayPatil_afterGENESIS_1-27.jpg`: full document of GEONIC paper with multiple overlaps
- `Comparison_GEONIC_vs_GENESIS_EN.csv`: tabular analysis of matched concepts

### 📌 Summary of overlaps

| Mechanism                        | Present in GENESIS | Present in GEONIC |
|----------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Curvature saturation (K ≤ 1/λ⁶) | ✅                | ✅                |
| Regular core replacing singularity | ✅              | ✅                |
| Geometric backreaction f'(K)     | ✅                | ✅                |
| Torsion-inspired field terms     | ✅                | ⛔ (recast)        |
| Observables (ringdown, shadows)  | ✅                | ✅                |

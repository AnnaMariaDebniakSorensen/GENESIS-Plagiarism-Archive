### üìå Summary

Uday Patil‚Äôs earlier paper contained none of these features.  
All mechanisms appeared in GENESIS (public on Zenodo June 19, 2025), and subsequently appeared in the new GEONIC document (mid-July 2025). No citation, no acknowledgment.

This constitutes a strong case of intellectual reuse without attribution.

Subject: Concerning the Overlap Between GEONIC Gravity and the GENESIS Model

Dear [Editor / Professor / Colleague],

I would like to raise a serious concern regarding Uday Patil‚Äôs recent work titled ‚ÄúGEONIC: Non-Singular Blackholes Theory‚Äù. After a thorough comparative analysis with my previously published theoretical model GENESIS: A Torsion-Based Cosmological Framework (DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.15701148 , published on June 19, 2025), I have identified a significant number of conceptually identical mechanisms introduced in Patil's later version.

While Patil‚Äôs earlier cosmological work (dated June 2025) contains no mention of bounded curvature, core regularization, torsion-inspired geometry, or gravitational self-regulation, his new 27-page GEONIC manuscript (shared on social media post-July 1) reproduces‚Äîwithout citation‚Äîthe following original contributions introduced in GENESIS:

    Bounded curvature condition K‚â§1/Œª6K‚â§1/Œª6,

    Suppression of singularities via a smooth regulating function f(K)=tanh‚Å°(KŒª6)f(K)=tanh(KŒª6),

    Replacement of singularities with a finite-density, geometrically defined core (TorusAM analogue),

    Introduction of an effective geometric energy‚Äìmomentum tensor TŒºŒΩgeoTŒºŒΩgeo‚Äã,

    Modified Friedmann equations via curvature feedback (analogous to EC-TOV in GENESIS),

    Thermodynamic stabilization of black hole remnants through geometric resistance,

    Observable signatures including shifts in ringdown frequencies and photon sphere radii,

    Rotational equilibrium mechanism countering collapse (analogous to THA in GENESIS).

All of these mechanisms are introduced in GENESIS across parts I‚ÄìIII, with time-stamped and publicly indexed records. Their appearance in Patil‚Äôs work‚Äîwithout attribution‚Äîraises serious concerns about scientific integrity, originality, and proper scholarly conduct.

I respectfully request that this matter be reviewed. A side-by-side comparative document is available upon request, clearly showing the conceptual and structural parallels.

Sincerely,

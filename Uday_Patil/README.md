## Uday Patil Case: Suspected Reuse of GENESIS Framework (Post-June 2025)

This case documents the reuse of multiple mechanisms and predictions from the GENESIS model 
by Uday Patil, in his paper "GEONIC: Non-Singular Blackholes Theory", published after GENESIS (June 19, 2025).

### 🧾 Evidence
## Uday Patil Case: Suspected Reuse of GENESIS Framework (Post-June 2025)

This case documents the suspected reuse of multiple concepts and mechanisms from the GENESIS model (published June 19, 2025, DOI: [10.5281/ZENODO.15701148](https://doi.org/10.5281/ZENODO.15701148)) in Uday Patil's later work "GEONIC: Non-Singular Blackholes Theory".

### 📌 Summary

Uday Patil’s earlier paper contained none of these features.  
All mechanisms appeared in GENESIS (public on Zenodo June 19, 2025), and subsequently appeared in the new GEONIC document (mid-July 2025). No citation, no acknowledgment.

This constitutes a strong case of intellectual reuse without attribution.

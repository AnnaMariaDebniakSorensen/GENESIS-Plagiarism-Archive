This repository documents and timestamps suspected uncredited reuse of the GENESIS framework (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15701148) in scientific documents published after its release.

## üìÇ Archive of Pre-GENESIS SKB Work (Screenshots ZIP)

This ZIP archive contains 27 screenshots from James Cupps' earlier materials (before GENESIS was published) that document the state of his "Spacetime Klein Bottle" (SKB) theory prior to the public release of GENESIS on June 19, 2025.

**Key context:**
- At that time, the SKB model was conceptual and visual, without equations.
- No quantization conditions, mass‚Äìperiod formulas, holonomy angles, or flux integrals were included.
- These features appeared *suddenly* in July 2025 ‚Äî directly after GENESIS became available.

This archive serves as time-stamped evidence of the conceptual stage of the SKB model before mathematical borrowing.

üßæ Summary of the Case: Uncredited Reuse of GENESIS-Derived Mechanisms in the SKB Model

This archive documents a detailed case of suspected plagiarism involving the sudden incorporation of unique mathematical and conceptual mechanisms from the GENESIS framework into the Spacetime Klein Bottle (SKB) model published by James Cupps in July 2025.
‚ö†Ô∏è Context

The GENESIS framework (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15701148) was released publicly on June 19, 2025, introducing a novel theory that unifies General Relativity and particle physics through torsion-based geometry and topological dynamics.

Before that release, James Cupps‚Äô SKB model existed as a conceptual outline ‚Äî visually elegant, with metaphoric language and illustrations ‚Äî but lacking in any mathematical formulation or predictive framework.

After GENESIS became available, the SKB model underwent a sudden and dramatic mathematical transformation, incorporating formulations, variables, structures, and even numerical results that appear directly inspired by GENESIS ‚Äî without citation.
üîç Key Overlaps

The following components were absent from SKB before June 2025 and appeared suddenly in the July version ‚Äî mirroring GENESIS point for point:

    Mass‚ÄìPeriod Quantization Relation
    GENESIS introduced a Bohr‚ÄìSommerfeld-like approach using temporal periodicity. SKB adopted the same logic and notation.

    Pin‚Åª Spinor Structure
    Used in GENESIS to explain neutrino chirality on non-orientable manifolds. SKB incorporated identical formalism post-GENESIS.

    Holonomy Angles & Z‚ÇÉ Symmetry
    GENESIS introduced specific angular corrections (+0.10, ‚Äì0.20 rad) to explain quark charge. SKB mirrored the same values.

    Flux Quantization for Charge
    GENESIS used integral expressions over 2D surfaces to derive charge quantization. SKB reused the concept and math directly.

    Frame-Dragging Cross-Terms in Metric
    GENESIS included an angular dt‚ÄìdœÜ metric coupling. SKB introduced this term in July with identical physical interpretation.

    Binding Energy Formula
    GENESIS derived proton mass using a specific torsional binding energy term. SKB used the same formula.

    Electron & Proton Mass Calculations
    GENESIS predicted known mass values using original torsional geometry. SKB repeated the same calculations and structure.

    Topological Model of Dark Matter (DM) üß®
    GENESIS proposed a fully geometric explanation of dark matter based on Yukawa-like torsion screening and curvature gradients ‚Äî distinct from all prior literature.
    In July, SKB suddenly introduced a topological view of dark matter and energy that closely parallels GENESIS:

        Use of torsional voids and screening,

        No need for new particles,

        Smooth, emergent geometric density profile.
        This was not present in SKB before June, and is a clear conceptual borrowing.

üß≠ Why This Matters

This is not a debate about competition ‚Äî it's about scientific attribution. If GENESIS influenced the evolution of another theory, that influence must be acknowledged. Silence, denial, or appropriation without citation violates the principles of academic integrity and damages trust in the scientific process.

Mr. Cupps has been given the opportunity to address these points privately and professionally. Despite multiple chances, he:

    Failed to engage with specific mathematical comparisons,

    Denied influence while presenting overlapping results,

    Asserted vague claims of independent development with no timestamped proofs,

    Deflected with personal commentary and accusations.


    Baryon Chirality & Asymmetry üß¨
GENESIS introduced a topological mechanism for baryon chirality and matter‚Äìantimatter asymmetry, grounded in:

    Non-orientable spinor transport (Pin‚Åª geometry),

    Spontaneous chirality breaking during collapse,

    Mirror projections of spinors across torsional boundaries (e.g. THA).
    SKB later integrated identical chirality constraints, even using the same Pin‚Åª inversion rules ‚Äî despite never proposing a chirality-based baryon asymmetry before GENESIS.
    This approach was absent from prior SKB drafts and has no precedent in published literature outside GENESIS.

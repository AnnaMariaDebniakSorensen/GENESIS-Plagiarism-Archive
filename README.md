# GENESIS Plagiarism Archive

This repository documents and timestamps suspected uncredited reuse of the GENESIS framework (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15701148) in scientific documents published after its release.

## üßæ Cases

- [James Cupps (Spacetime Klein Bottle)](James_Cupps/README.md)

## üìÇ Archive of Pre-GENESIS SKB Work (Screenshots ZIP)

This ZIP archive contains 27 screenshots from James Cupps' earlier materials (before GENESIS was published) that document the state of his "Spacetime Klein Bottle" (SKB) theory prior to the public release of GENESIS on June 19, 2025.

**Key context:**
- At that time, the SKB model was conceptual and visual, without equations.
- No quantization conditions, mass‚Äìperiod formulas, holonomy angles, or flux integrals were included.
- These features appeared *suddenly* in July 2025 ‚Äî directly after GENESIS became available.

This archive serves as time-stamped evidence of the conceptual stage of the SKB model before mathematical borrowing.

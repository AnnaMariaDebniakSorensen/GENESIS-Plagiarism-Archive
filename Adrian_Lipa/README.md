# Case: Adrian Lipa (LVUT-CIEL/0 Theory)

This folder contains documented and timestamped evidence of conceptual and mathematical convergence between the GENESIS model (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15701148, published June 19, 2025) and Adrian Lipa’s paper "The Definitive Axioms – Theory of Everything" (dated July 3, 2025, uploaded to ResearchGate).

## 🔍 Summary of Concerns

The July version of Adrian Lipa’s manuscript contains numerous concepts and mathematical structures that:

- Were **not present** in his earlier version from May 2025 (13 pages),
- **Appeared first in GENESIS**, including exact terminology, operators, equations, and Lagrangian structures,
- Are presented without attribution, citation, or acknowledgment of GENESIS or its author.

## 📌 Timeline of Events

| Date         | Event |

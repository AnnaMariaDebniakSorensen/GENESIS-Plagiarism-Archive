## üö© Summary of the Case

Chris McGinty published a document titled *"The Schism in Physics and the Necessity of a New Foundation"*, in which he presents the **MEQ (McGinty Equation)** and a symbolic formalism termed *"Cognispheric Symbolic Language (CSL)"*. His article contains **numerous structural and conceptual similarities** to the GENESIS framework publicly released four weeks earlier.

Despite the public availability and timestamped release of GENESIS on Zenodo (with complete field equations, predictions, and definitions), McGinty does **not cite the framework**, nor acknowledge prior sources on torsional geometry, fractal recursion, or metric signature transitions.

## ‚ùó Notes

- The MEQ document uses language and formulation that appear adapted or inspired by GENESIS, without attribution.  
- McGinty‚Äôs public profile shows no academic affiliation, limiting formal ethics reporting options.  
- This archive serves to **timestamp** the overlap and assert the original priority of GENESIS.

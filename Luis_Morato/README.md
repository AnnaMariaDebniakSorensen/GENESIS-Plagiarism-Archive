# Case: Luis Morató de Dalmases

## ❗ Suspected Uncredited Reuse of GENESIS Framework



The conceptual foundation of both Zenodo publications by Luis Morató de Dalmases relies heavily on the GENESIS model — particularly its treatment of dark energy as structured geometric fields, its use of bifurcation topology (S²∩T), toroidal solitons, and phase-induced resonance.

❗ However, **GENESIS is neither cited nor acknowledged** in any form, and the **true author of the theoretical framework (Anna Maria Dębniak Sørensen)** is not credited anywhere in the works.

This constitutes a clear breach of scientific ethics and attribution.

## 🧩 Conceptual Overlaps

| GENESIS Concept | Morató Equivalent | Comment |
|-----------------|------------------|---------|
| Torsion-based dark energy (four-form) | Dark Energy Quasiparticles (DEQ) | Same structural function |
| Bifurcation at S² ∩ T | Z₀ region at S² ∩ T³ | Same geometry |
| Toroidal soliton (Torus AM) | Hyperphasic Toroidal Plasma | Almost identical topology |
| Rs-resonance in jets | Rs-resonance from Riemann zeros | Identical naming and mechanism |
| Photon generation via torsion phase echo | Phase-locked photon from DEQ | Same causal principle |
| Emergent time from torsion | Resonant time from DEQ states | Functional equivalence |

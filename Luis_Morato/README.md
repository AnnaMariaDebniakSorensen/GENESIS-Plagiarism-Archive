## 🧩 Conceptual Overlaps

| GENESIS Concept | Morató Equivalent | Comment |
|-----------------|------------------|---------|
| Torsion-based dark energy (four-form) | Dark Energy Quasiparticles (DEQ) | Same structural function |
| Bifurcation at S² ∩ T | Z₀ region at S² ∩ T³ | Same geometry |
| Toroidal soliton (Torus AM) | Hyperphasic Toroidal Plasma | Almost identical topology |
| Rs-resonance in jets | Rs-resonance from Riemann zeros | Identical naming and mechanism |
| Photon generation via torsion phase echo | Phase-locked photon from DEQ | Same causal principle |
| Emergent time from torsion | Resonant time from DEQ states | Functional equivalence |

## 📎 Evidence

- See screenshots, schematics and textual overlaps in attached files.
- Publication dates show GENESIS was released **before** both of Morató’s uploads.
- No citation or attribution to GENESIS was provided.
